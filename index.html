      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I’m <strong>Christian Dell'Edera</strong> — an aspiring game developer, a computer science student, and a huge fan of gaming. I am hoping to create immersive experiences that blend storytelling, art, and technology. Alongside my passion for game development, I continue to work professionally as an actor, bringing characters to life on stage and screen.

      <h2>My Background</h2>

      </div>
      <p>
        I’m a sophomore at <strong>Pace University</strong>, majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong> with a minor in <strong>Game Development</strong>. I grew up in <strong>Brooklyn, New York</strong>, and before diving into code and game engines, I came from the world of <strong>performing arts</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an actor, I’ve always loved character, emotion, and stagecraft — and now I’m applying that same creative energy to game development. I’m fascinated by how games can tell stories, create worlds, and connect people. I believe that the best games are those that resonate with players on a personal level, and I strive to create experiences that do just that.

      <h2>Gaming Inspiration</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up with the <strong>GameCube</strong> and <strong>Wii</strong>, and games like <strong>Super Mario Galaxy</strong> had a huge impact on me. Over time, I discovered my love for deeper narratives and unique mechanics in titles like <strong>Persona 5</strong>, <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles</strong>, and <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake & Rebirth</strong>. These games opened my eyes to the potential of interactive storytelling and the emotional connections they can create.

      <p>
        Those games shaped how I see interactive media — not just as entertainment, but as a powerful form of art and connection.

    <!-- Game Dev Journey -->
    <section>
      <h2>My Experience in Game Development/Coding</h2>
      <p>
        I started building games in <strong>Unity</strong> during my Game Dev courses at Pace. Every project has been a hands-on opportunity to think like a developer: solving design problems, building mechanics, and refining ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am also learning other programming languages in my other classes like <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. (I even made this website using HTML and CSS!) I’m excited to keep expanding my skills and exploring new technologies in the game development world.

      <h2>Explore My Work</h2>
      <p>
        The games I’ve made so far are part of my coursework — they are my first ever projects in game development. I’m excited to keep expanding my skills and exploring new technologies in the game development world. Check out the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page to see what I’ve built. There are more games that I will surely be adding to the page in the future!
      </p>
